# Native Mobile App - Build Instructions

This document explains how to build and run the native Android and iOS apps
generated for **Paradigm IFS**. These apps use a **pure Native WebView**
approach (no Capacitor/Cordova) for maximum control and zero external
dependencies.

---

## 📱 Android Build

The Android project is a standard **Android Studio** project located in the
`android/` folder.

### **Prerequisites**

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.

### **Steps to Run**

1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Select **"Open"** and choose the `android/` folder in this project.
   - _Wait for Gradle Sync to complete._ (Android Studio will automatically
     generate the Gradle wrapper).
3. Connect a physical Android device or start an Emulator.
4. Click the **Run (Play)** button (green triangle) in the toolbar.

### **Build APK / AAB**

- **APK (for direct install):**
  - Go to `Build` > `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` > `Build APK(s)`.
  - The APK will be generated in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
- **AAB (Play Store):**
  - Go to `Build` > `Generate Signed Bundle / APK`.
  - Choose `Android App Bundle`.
  - Follow the wizard to create a keystore and sign your app.

### **Configuration**

- **App Icon**: Replace `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher.xml` with
  your own vector or image asset.
- **Package Name**: `com.paradigm.ifs` (Defined in `android/app/build.gradle`).
- **Firebase**: Replace `android/app/google-services.json` with your real file
  from Firebase Console.

## 🍎 iOS Build

The iOS source code is located in `ios/ParadigmIFS/`.

### **Prerequisites**

- macOS with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

### **Steps to Setup & Run**

Since we generated the source files directly (to avoid fragile project file
issues), you'll create a fresh project and drag the files in.

1. Open **Xcode**.
2. Select **"Create a new Xcode Project"**.
3. Choose **iOS** > **App**.
4. Set **Product Name** to `ParadigmIFS`.
5. Set **Organization Identifier** to `com.paradigm` (so Bundle ID is
   `com.paradigm.ParadigmIFS`).
6. Interface: **Storyboard**.
7. Language: **Swift**.
8. Save the project to the `ios/` folder (or anywhere you prefer).
9. **Delete** the default `ViewController.swift`, `SceneDelegate.swift`, and
   `AppDelegate.swift` created by Xcode.
10. **Drag and Drop** the following files from `ios/ParadigmIFS/` into your
    Xcode project (ensure "Copy items if needed" is checked):
    - `AppDelegate.swift`
    - `SceneDelegate.swift`
    - `ViewController.swift`
    - `Info.plist` (Choose "Replace" if asked, or manually merge permissions)
    - `LaunchScreen.storyboard` (Replace the default one)
    - `GoogleService-Info.plist`
11. Select your target device (Simulator or Physics Device).
12. Click **Run (Play)**.

### **Permissions**

The `Info.plist` includes permissions for:

- Camera (File Uploads)
- Photo Library (File Uploads)
- Microphone (Video Uploads)

### **Firebase**

1. Add the **Firebase SDK** via Swift Package Manager (`File` > `Add Packages` >
   `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk`).
2. Replace `GoogleService-Info.plist` with your real file.
3. Uncomment the Firebase code in `AppDelegate.swift` (it's currently prepared
   for you).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Android: Gradle Sync Failed?**

- Ensure you have a valid JDK selected in Android Studio (`Settings` >
  `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Build Tools` > `Gradle`).
- Try `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart`.

### **iOS: "File not found"?**

- Ensure you checked "Copy items if needed" when dragging files into Xcode.
- Ensure the file targets are checked in the File Inspector (right sidebar in
  Xcode).

### **WebView White Screen?**

- Ensure your computer/device has internet access.
- The app is configured to load `https://paradigm-ifs.vercel.app`. Verify this
  URL is accessible.
